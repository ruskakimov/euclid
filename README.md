# Euclid
 Web app for building geometric constructions with only straight edge and compass.

 > Compass-and-straightedge construction, also known as ruler-and-compass construction or classical construction, is the construction of lengths, angles, and other geometric figures using only an idealized ruler and compass. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass-and-straightedge_construction)

### Current functionality:
- draw line
- draw circle
- hand tool (move canvas around)
- zoom into any point up to 10x with scroll wheel
- infinite canvas (ok, technically not infinite, works as long as all coordinates are within Number range)
- undo drawings with `ctrl`+`z`
- redo drawings with `ctrl`+`y`

### TODO:
 - add GUI for undo and redo
 - fast switch between tools with hotkeys
